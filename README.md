## Overview
Reddit-Nemesis is an AI-powered Reddit bot that scrapes through subreddits, finds posts, and leaves pseudo-friendly comment contracting every single point on the original post. This project is the evil-version of my other project: [reddit-omni](https://github.com/diegovelilla/reddit-omni), which automatizes question-answering on reddit posts.

## Features
- Promoting social interaction
- Automatizing debate
- Relieving others who take their angers on the bot
- Resurrecting dead subreddits

## Installation
To install Reddit-Nemesis, follow these steps:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diegovelilla/reddit-nemesis
   cd reddit-nemesis
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration:
Set up your API keys in the **.env** file inside the config model:

    GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    CLIENT_ID="your_api_key_here"
    CLIENT_SECRET="your_api_key_here"
    SERPER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    USERNAME="your_reddit_username"
    PASSWORD="your_reddit_password_here"
If you just want to try it and not actually leave a comment, you can leave **USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** as it is, since scrapping reddit does not require to log in.
## Usage:
To use Reddit-Nemesis just run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m app
```
